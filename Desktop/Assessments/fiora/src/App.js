            Hi, I'm Fiora! I'm a NYC native who loves live music, traveling, and
            watching the Yankees win. Having studied architecture, I have a
            background in design and an understanding of how different
            elements/components can work together optimally to create a good web
            design and user experience. IÂ love the sense of accomplishment I get
            from solving problems by thinking outside the box, breaking them
            down from a high level, and tackling them piece by piece. I am
            currently exploring opportunities for growth as a Software Developer
            in New York City and look forward to working with a team that values
            collaboration in a learning environment. I am someone that can find
            happiness in many situations and I love to learn!
